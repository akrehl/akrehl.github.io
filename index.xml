      <description>&lt;p&gt;The speed of development and innovations on the web platform, at the time of writing, is enormous.
There are a number of new things we all heard of. I am following some of them with detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not YET an active part of the open source community, but this will change!
I already have some ideas on my todo list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my future projects will be listed here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Adrian Krehl and currently a student in applied computer science at the Hochschule Hannover, Germany.
Additionally I am working in a small software company. I love technology and coding in a variety of languages both at
work and in my spare time. When Iâ€™m not coding, I try to spend time with my family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-this-site-is-about-and-what-not&#34;&gt;What this site is about and what not&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did make this site for my own purpose. Mainly for giving me a good platform for testing and sharing new ideas and code
with the community. I do not want to label the site to any specific topic or programming language. I am just to
interested in all of them ðŸ˜ƒ . I consider myself a beginner in software engineering, so please do not copy and
paste any code without a closer look. Take a look at my &lt;a href=&#34;https://akrehl.com/license.txt&#34;&gt;license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may already noticed, I am not a native english speaker. Please be kind, I give my very best!
Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.&lt;/p&gt;
